## Project Introduction

UK2-admin is a simple and clean background management template based on Nest.js, Vue3, Vite6, Typescript, and Naive UI. It implements complete functions in a simple way and considers code specifications as much as possible. It is easy to read, understand, and does not over-encapsulate, making it convenient for secondary development.

## Project description

UK2-admin is based on Nova-admin for lightweight secondary development, integrating the Nest.js backend written by the author himself. It continues the clear and concise structural design and easy-to-understand code style, without over-encapsulation, making it easy to get started and customize.

It should be noted that most of the functions of this project come from my personal development needs, and may have a certain subjective tendency and are not "universal", but for this reason, it may just fit your usage scenario. If you are also looking for a direct, non-complex and convenient for secondary development, you might as well give this project a try. So I decided to open source and look forward to meeting developers with similar needs.

### The evolution of this version mainly includes the following

- Replaced Alova with Axios
- Complete front-end and back-end code, such as menus, permissions, users, roles, departments, dictionaries, logs, file management, etc.
- Based on personal usage scenarios, a general DataTable component is encapsulated.
