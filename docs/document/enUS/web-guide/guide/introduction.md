## Project Introduction

UK2-admin is a full-stack backend management system based on Nest.js, Vue3, Vite6, TypeScript, and Naive UI. It implements complete functionality in a straightforward manner, with careful consideration for code standards, readability, and ease of understandingâ€”avoiding excessive encapsulation to facilitate secondary development.

## Project description

UK2-admin is based on Nova-admin for lightweight secondary development, integrating the [Nest.js backend](https://github.com/akizono/uk2-admin-nest) written by the author himself. It continues the clear and concise structural design and easy-to-understand code style, without over-encapsulation, making it easy to get started and customize.

It should be noted that most of the functions of this project come from my personal development needs, and may have a certain subjective tendency and are not "universal", but for this reason, it may just fit your usage scenario. If you are also looking for a direct, non-complex and convenient for secondary development, you might as well give this project a try. So I decided to open source and look forward to meeting developers with similar needs.

### The evolution of this version mainly includes the following

- Replaced Alova with Axios
- Complete front-end and back-end code, such as menus, permissions, users, roles, departments, dictionaries, logs, file management, etc.
- Based on personal usage scenarios, a general DataTable component is encapsulated.
