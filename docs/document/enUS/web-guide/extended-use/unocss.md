# UnoCSS

- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/): Instant on-demand atomic CSS engine
- [Interactive Docs](https://unocss.dev/interactive/): Unocss interactive class name query file
- [tailwindcss](https://www.tailwindcss.cn/docs/installation): tailwindcss file

The two are very similar in use, but UnoCSS is lighter and more expandable and custom-friendly. The content of the unocss file is basically about configuration, while the content of the tailwindcss file is basically about usage. What class name should be used to query in tailwindcss file to better experience.

The experience of using unocss interactive query files directly will be very bad, because how to check the naming rules without a rough understanding? What to check? Some abbreviations will not be reflected when directly querying attributes. Interactive files are more suitable for use after mastering the class name rules.
